# Sorting-array-with-multiple-data-in-PHP-by-a-specific-key
When you have a array with multiple data types and would like to sort the field by a specific key within the field.

It comes in handy when you retrieve data into an array from a database or populate an array with a PHP loop such as foreach or while, and then want to sort the array by a particular key.

The function has the parameters "array", "key" and "sorting ASC or DESC". Unless the last parameter is specified, ASC sorting is the primary choice.
